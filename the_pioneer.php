	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>WhitmanPioneer.com is the online presence of <span class="pub">The Pioneer</span>, the weekly student-run newspaper of <a href="http://www.whitman.edu/" target="_blank">Whitman College</a>. I redesigned it from the ground up with a tailor-made Wordpress theme, a MySQL database, HTML5, LESS, and jQuery. It was my first web project. The result won several awards from the <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/" target="_blank">Associated Collegiate Press</a> (ACP). </p>

	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>After serving as <span class="pub">The Pioneer</span>'s Art Director, I was approached by the editors-in-chief to take on the project because of my previous Art Director role at the paper and my interest in web design. </p>
	
	<p>After conducting a site audit and examining a number of other newspaper sites, we established a list of goals for the redesign:  </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> cleaner overall look and feel </li>
		<li> simpler navigation</li>
		<li> more articles on homepage</li>
		<li> specialized section pages </li>
		<li> improved SEO </li>
		<li> enhanced search and archive access </li>
		<li> reduced plugin count and dependencies </li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The site has a large amount of dynamic content. As with many sites that publish new articles frequently, it has relatively high traffic.  Search engine optimization was crucial, as was a solid back-end.  Additionally, an interface enabling student journalists and editors to write, share, edit, and publish their articles was needed.   Student newspapers evolve quickly: There is complete staff turnover every four years, so the site had to be flexible enough to withstand major changes.</p>

	<h2>Process</h2>
	<h4> Design</h4>
	<p>I prepared mockups in Fireworks that addressed our objectives. The new layout was neat and colorful, with a grid structure reminiscent of the multi-column layouts of traditional newspapers. <span class="pub">The Pioneer</span>â€™s beautiful artwork was a focal point.</p>
	
	<p>An article sidebar listed other relevant and popular content. This helped to engage readers and decreased our bounce rate.</p>
	
	<h4> Development </h4>
	<p>I built the site using Wordpress as the CMS and a MySQL database as the content repository. Wordpress provided a search engine-friendly template structure with clean page titles and permalinks and took care of the worst of the database administration.  Another benefit was the built-in administration portal, which provided a browser-based workflow for <span class="pub">Pioneer</span> staff to write/edit articles and article metadata.</p>
	
	<p>I used the Wordpress codex and function library to build around twenty template pages, including individualized section pages (News, Sports, A&amp;E, etc.). The stylesheets were written in <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a>, a dynamic stylesheet language, which kept the styles concise. It also made them versatile if the site was overhauled by new editors down the line.</p>

	<h2>Award-winning</h2>
	<p>The redesigned site won "Online Pacemaker" awards from the <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/" target="_blank">Associated Collegiate Press</a> (ACP), the highest honor a university newspaper website can win in the U.S., each year since its relaunch (<a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/opm13.html" target="_blank">2013</a>, <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/opm12.html" target="_blank">2012</a>). The site has also won 1st place in the "Best in Show" category in every ACP convention competition (<?php //<a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/m14bs.html" target="_blank" 2014</a>, ?><a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/m13bs.html" target="_blank">2013</a>, <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/f12bs.html" target="_blank">2012</a>, <a href="http://studentpress.org/acp/winners/m11bs.html">2011</a>) <span class="pub">Pioneer</span> staff have attended.</p>
